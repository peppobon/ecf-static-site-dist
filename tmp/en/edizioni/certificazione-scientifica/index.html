        <h2>Synthesis</h2>

        <p>Scientific certification of the works published by Edizioni Ca’ Foscari - Digital Publishing: all essays
            published in this volume have received a favourable opinion by at least two subject-matter experts, through an
            anonymous peer review process under the responsibility of the Scientific Committee of the series. The
            evaluations were conducted in adherence to the scientific and editorial criteria established by Edizioni Ca’
            Foscari.
            <br/><a href="#">Scarica il modulo di peer-review qui</a>
        </p>
        <p>The Publishing House has a Scientific Committee that consists of 6 members, each one of them representing every
            Department and, therefore, every area of study (liberal arts, linguistic, economic and scientific). The
            Committee evaluates and judges all the new proposals of journals and series according to the following basic
            criteria:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the series must have an Editor and a Scientific Committee, consisting mostly of senior researchers from
                other universities (preferably international), of proved scientific value;
            </li>
            <li>the series must display originality in subject matter and research method. </li>
            <li>the series must have an Editorial Committee that handles the peer-review work flow following the Publishing
                House criteria and verifies the texts’ conformity with the editorial rules.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The editorial group works in order to guarantee the observance of these general guidelines.</p>
        <p>The administration and the management commitee have control- and veto power over the individual scientific
            committees, once consulted them, in case obvious negligences are detected.</p>

        <p class="space-above">The Publishing House makes available a double and anonymous peer-review platform and offers
            steady support and up-to-date information regarding its use. The scientific evaluation standard recommended
            provides for a double anonymous evaluation performed by independent researchers, not belonging to the scientific
            committees.</p>
        <p>Each Scientific Committee identifies its own reviewers. They are required to be experts in the series’ field of
            research and must have a considerable number of previous publications, which in turn have been submitted to a
            double and anonymous peer-review process. It is recommended that they don’t belong to the university that the
            series is affiliated to.</p>
        <p>Within the platform, every series has a dedicated profile, managed by the director and the Scientific
            Committee.</p>
        <p>Each paper is anonymously uploaded to the platform by the author and then assigned to a couple of reviewers by
            the scientific committee. The reviewers must establish whether the paper is “accepted” or “refused”. In case it
            is “accepted”, it must be distinguished if it is a) “accepted without reserve”, b) “accepted with request of
            little interventions” He must then fill in a form, which requires a judgment on several levels (Poor, Need
            Improvement, Average, Good, Excellent) about relevance, methodology, completeness, coherence and formal quality,
            and a comment for each of the above-mentioned fields.</p>
        <p>The paper is rejected even if only one reviewer rejects it. In this case, the scientific Editor can decide to
            submit it to a third judgment.</p>
        <p>If the reviewers request any intervention, the author must upload a second draft of the paper, which will be then
            approved by the series’ Editor.If the reviewers request any intervention, the author must upload a second draft
            of the paper, which will be then approved by the series’ Editor.</p>
        <p>At the end of this process, the Publishing House verifies the paper’s compliance to the editorial guidelines and,
            if necessary, reserves the right to ask the Editorial Board for interventions in order to adapt the paper to the
            standards. </p>

        <p class="space-above">The process is, thus, ended and the evaluated and approved documents can proceed towards
            publication</p>
