                            individual profiles of their Authors and Reviewers. They also commit themselves to the
                            insertion and regular update of all Authors and Reviewers’ identifying data.

                        <li>In order to guarantee to Readers and Authors alike a scientifically sound double-blind peer
                            review, caution must be taken to keep Authors and Reviewers unaware of each other’s
                            identity. Therefore, it is essential that Authors, Reviewers (in case they enclose any
                            personal data or attachment) and any other operating subject erase Authors and Reviewers’
                            personal data from their documents before submitting them to the peer review process:

                                <li>Any information that may lead to the identification of Authors and/or Reviewers must
                                    be eliminated. Author will quote themselves only as “Author”, both in text and in

                            Journal’s/Series’ Director also has a responsibility to ensure that review deadlines are
                            respected. All these procedures are not possible outside of ECF’s online editorial platform.
                        </li>
                        <li>If Reviewers ask that the article be modified, the Author has ten days to upload a second
                            draft of their paper.
                        </li>
                        <li>The editing and layout process starts as soon as the peer review of every article has been
                            completed. Should ECF identify deficiencies, inaccuracies or lack of necessary information
                            in an article in the course of the editorial work, its editorial board holds the right to
                            suspend the editing process and return the article to its Author, asking them to make the
                            necessary changes. The delivery time of the first drafts by ECF will consequently shift.

                        <li>ECF is the Press of Ca’ Foscari University. It has a scientific board made up of of four
                            representatives – one for each of the four main disciplinary areas (humanities, languages,
                            economics and sciences) to which the eight departments of the University refer to.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Board receives, evaluates and approves every proposal of a new Journal/Series on the
                            basis of the following criteria:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Journal/Series shall have a director and a scientific board of renowned
                                    scholars. ECF recommends that the scholars sitting in scientific boards are chosen
                                    among researchers and teachers working in Universities other than Ca’ Foscari, and
                                    preferentially in foreign institutions.

                                    ECF’s editorial criteria and respecting the Journal’s/Series’ periodicity.

                        <li>Reviewers shall explain their decision by filling an evaluation sheet, where they shall

                            ‘Adequacy of citations and accuracy of references’, ‘Presentation and quality of
                            argumentation’, and ‘Writing style and grammar’. Reviewers will evaluate each of these
                            fields on a five level scale: ‘Poor’, ‘Improvable’, ‘Average’, ‘Good’, ‘Excellent’ For each
                            of these judgments an extended, comment is requested.
                        </li>
                        <li>The negative opinion of even one of the two Reviewers will automatically mark the article as
                            “rejected” by the evaluating system. In this case, the Scientific Director can submit the
                            document to a third Reviewer.
                        </li>
                        <li>If Reviewers requested the article to be modified the Author shall submit a second draft of
                            the paper. This second draft will be accepted only in case of a positive response from the
                            Scientific Director.
                        </li>
                        <li>After the end of the peer review process ECF will verify once again the document’s
                            compliance with the editorial guidelines and, if necessary, will ask the Scientific Director
                            or the Editorial Board to intervene in order to standardise the document. After this last
                            step, ECF’s copy editors will start the publication process for the accepted documents.
                        </li>
                        <li>The whole reviewing process is tracked, memorised and archived on the platform’s database,

                            access to the archive linked to their respective profiles, where they will find records of

                        Open Access publishing is not without its costs. Therefore, the Publisher (ECF) charges a fee of
                        8€ (+VAT) per page (2000 characters, spaces included) for each article or monograph, after
                        acceptance. This fee applies for Journals/Series or series affiliated with Institutions or
                        Research entities not linked with Ca’ Foscari University of Venice. If the Journals/Series or
                        series is affiliated to Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, publication fees are met by the single
                        Departments on the basis of specific arrangements between the Departments and ECF. In any case,
                        Authors’ institutions – and not individual Authors – will be charged. In case of an article of
                        monograph with particular features or complex content (non-western languages, non-standard
                        graphic elaborations, etcetera), Authors’ institutions may be charged with extra fees, to be
                        determined by ECF.</p>
